Compilation of Project Code for Object-Oriented Programming (C++)

## (1) Triangle Class - Coding a Class
### (class) Triangle stores the side length for an equilateral triangle, as well as a border char and fill char for the traingle. The class can return the side length of the triangle, its perimeter, and its area. It can also grow the triangle (increase side length by 1), shrink the traingle (decrement side length), set the traingle's border char, set the triangle's fill char, draw the triangle (print to screen), and summarize all triangle contents.
- triangle.h
- triangle.cpp

## (2) Temperature Class - Further Class Implementation Practice
### (class) Temperature objects represent a temperature in terms of degree and scales, along with stored format setting. The object will always represent a valid temperature (cannot be lower than 0 degrees Kelvin). The class can appropriately create and update temperature objects, convert between Farenheit, Celsuis, and Kelvin scales, and compare two temperature objects.
- temperature.h
- temperature.cpp

## (3) Rational Number Class - Basic Operator Overloading
### (class) Mixed stores and manages rational numbers in a mixed number format (integer part and a fraction part).
- mixed.h
- mixed.cpp
