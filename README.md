## (1) Triangle Class - Coding a Class
### (class) Triangle stores the side length for an equilateral triangle, as well as a border char and fill char for the traingle. The class can return the side length of the triangle, its perimeter, and its area. It can also grow the triangle (increase side length by 1), shrink the traingle (decrement side length), set the traingle's border char, set the triangle's fill char, draw the triangle (print to screen), and summarize all triangle contents.
- triangle.h
- triangle.cpp

## (2) Rational Number Class - Basic Operator Overloading
### (class) Mixed stores and manages rational numbers in a mixed number format (integer part and a fraction part).
- mixed.h
- mixed.cpp
